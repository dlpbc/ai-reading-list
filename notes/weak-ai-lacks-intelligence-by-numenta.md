[Numenta](https://numenta.org) argues that:

We need to build better models of brain. ANN is an overly simplistic model of neurons in the brain based on neuroscience knowledge of the brain in the 1970s (a collection and interconnection of something called point neurons). They argue that modern day neuroscience now understand the brain to have **pyramidal neuron structure** and this can be used to upgrade our neural net models (instead of using a simplistic neuron model approach). They believe that Strong AI cannot be achieved/built using this crude neuron model.

For strong AI to be achieve, they suggest/believe: 
1. We must starting modeling neurons in ANN using present day understanding of bioliogical neurons. Hence our **realistic neurons** should have 2 attributes
    a. integration zones - not much was said about this, but each neuron should have are 3 integration zones. They are; proximal, distal and apical zones. A neuron can get different signals in these areas and they mean different things.
    b. predictive state - ability of a neuron to predict from its current connection that it will fire next. Neurons in current ANNs only having an active and inactive state. It needs to add a this predictive state as a third.

2. Movement: That is any stong (true) intelligent system being built should be able to move (which they argue could simply be about "taking actions that changes your point of observation").  
   They write:
   "Your brain is constantly computing not only what things are about to happen in the world around 
   you..."  
   I believe this is what Yann Lecun is currently tackling and belives is the next direction of AI
   research (link [here](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603803/facebooks-ai-chief-machines-could-learn-common-sense-from-video/))

   Generally speaking, I believe that Numenta's idea of movement is currently being tackled by
   **Reinforcement Learning** (which is all about agent exploration/interaction of environment/world with 
   rewards and punishments scheme in place)
