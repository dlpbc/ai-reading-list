# Datasets and Enviroments
### Dataset - SLAC (MIT/Facbook Research)
http://slac.csail.mit.edu/  
Note: Sparsely Labeled ACtion (SLAC) dataset consist of 200 classes of 520K untrimmed videos and 1.75 Million clip annotations (clips trimmed from the 520K videos). It is large scale dataset for video action recognition and localisation. Just like the **Moments in Time Dataset**, it is similar to other video action recognition datasets such as [Kinetics](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/open-source-datasets/kinetics/), [UCF-101](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php), [HMDB-51](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/#Downloads) etc.

### Dataset - Moments in Time (MIT/IBM Research)
http://moments.csail.mit.edu/  
Note: a large scale dataset for video action recognition and understanding from MIT/IBM research. This dataset is similar to other video action recognition datasets such as [Kinetics](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/open-source-datasets/kinetics/), [UCF-101](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php), [HMDB-51](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/#Downloads) etc. However, it differs by focusing on creating labels that are *basic* rather than *specific* to a given example. The *basic* labels form a building block that can be used to richly describe a scene. It is made up of 1 million video clip, each clip having a 3 seconds. Check out this [IBM blogpost](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2017/12/ai-video-understanding/) for more information.

### Environment - a Household Multimodal Environment (HoME) for AI agents
https://home-platform.github.io/  
Note: HoMe is a simulated platform where AI agents/bots can learn from vision, audio, simulated physics, and interaction with objects and other agents. Another platform similar to this one is the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/). Work done in this area mostly focus on creating algorithms that can learn to act/behave appropriately in the environment (simulated 3D world, like a video game)

### Environment - CARLA

### Google Vizier (A service for black box optimisation)
A tool that helps find configuration/hyparameters settings for your neural network training.  
Unfortunately, it's only available to google cloud compute users and internally for google staff.  
  
However, there's an open source implementation of this tool. (I haven't tried it out)
