## Google Vizier (A service for black box optimisation)
A tool that helps find configuration/hyparameters settings for your neural network training.  
Unfortunately, it's only available to google cloud compute users and internally for google staff.  
  
However, there's an open source implementation of this tool. (Disclaimer: I haven't tried it out)
