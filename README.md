# reading-list

Links to articles, blog posts, research papers, videos that I have read(watched) or will read(watch) in the future.

## Unread
[Metalearning] - article @cr
https://www.cifar.ca/assets/machines-learn-new-ways-of-learning/
Short Note: 

[Synthetic Gradients] - blog post @cr
http://iamtrask.github.io/2017/03/21/synthetic-gradients/
Short Note: rather than actually compute gradient via backprop, each NN layer approximates their gradient by learning.

[Information bottleneck] - article @cr
https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/
Short Note: link to an article written about a talk about potential explanation of why neural net works was given.

[about-sgd] - blogpost @cr
https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-peculiar-behavior-of-deep-learning-loss-surfaces-330cb741ec17
Short Note: 

[Meta Learning] - research paper @cr
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07417
Short Note: neural optimizer. authors learnt new optimizers from cifar-10 dataset and claim that they generalise to other tasks.

[CMU Fall 2017 NLP Course] - video @cr

Short Note:

[Learning Through Interation: Generalisation in Robot RL] - video @cr
