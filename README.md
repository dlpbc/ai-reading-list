#### [Synthetic Gradients] - blog post, speeding-up-training-nn  
http://iamtrask.github.io/2017/03/21/synthetic-gradients/  
*Short Note: rather than actually compute gradient via backprop, each NN layer approximates their gradient by learning.*

*Short Note: *

#### [Neural Optimizer search] - research paper, meta-learning  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07417  
*Short Note: neural optimizer. authors learnt new optimizers from cifar-10 dataset and claim that they generalise to other tasks.*

#### [Learning Through Interaction: Generalisation in Robot RL] - video (highly technical)  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko8IBbYjdq8  
*Short Note: Presenter presents a talk on the future of generalisation from two aspects. (a) Generalise to new tasks previously unseen (using visual video prediction) (b) Incorportate experiences from previous tasks into new tasks (few shot/transfer learning)*

#### [Understanding why Deep Nets work - Information bottleneck] - article, video (highly technical)  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLqJHjXihK8  
*Short Note: An hypothesis/theory of why/how (deep) neural nets works well. The basic idea is that the network learns to forget irrelevant parts of the training sample. Hence, only relevant information (features) of the training samples are squeezed through (the metaphorical bottleneck) as you propagate forward from layer to layer in a neural net.*

#### [Today’s Weak AI Lacks Intelligence by Numenta] - blogpost
https://medium.com/@Numenta/todays-weak-ai-lacks-intelligence-49869b4c61ae
*Short Note: They (Numenta) argue that we need to upgrade ANNs. Neurons in ANN were modeled after our neuro science understanding of the brain in the 1970s. There have been advances in Neuroscience about our understanding of neurons and Numenta believes this should be infused into our ANNs. See [here](https://github.com/dlpbc/ai-reading-list/notes/weak-ai-lacks-intelligence.md) for complete note.*
